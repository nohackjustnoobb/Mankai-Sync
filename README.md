# Mankai Sync

Mankai Sync is a sync server for the [mankai](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai), providing both a backend API and an admin web page for user management. Administrators can easily manage users through the admin page. The recommended way to run the app is with Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Running with Docker Compose

> **Important:**
>
> For security, edit the `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` values in your `docker-compose.yml` file before deploying or running in production.

1. Create an empty `db.sqlite3` file in the project root (if running for the first time). This ensures the Docker volume is mounted correctly as a file, not a directory.

   ```bash
   touch db.sqlite3
   ```

2. Build and start all services:

   ```
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Once started, the admin page will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the backend API at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).

4. To stop the services:
   ```
   sudo docker-compose down
   ```

## Security

For enhanced security, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to handle incoming traffic. Configure the proxy to only forward requests destined for `/api`, ensuring that the admin interface and admin API remain inaccessible from the public internet.
